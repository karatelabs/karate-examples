# Karate and Spring Boot

Since Karate fits well into Maven and Gradle projects, it is easy to run Karate tests as part of a Spring Boot project. You can start and stop the main application from a JUnit class and then run your Karate test-suite.

* [karate-demo](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/tree/master/karate-demo) - this is part of the main Karate open-source project, and has examples of how to use Karate to test a Spring Boot application
* [consumer-driven-contracts](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/tree/master/examples/consumer-driven-contracts) - this is a multi-module Maven project that is focused on testing a Spring Boot application
* [hello-karate](https://github.com/Sdaas/hello-karate) - an example created by the community, which tests a Spring Boot REST service using Karate from within IntelliJ, Maven, and Gradle.
