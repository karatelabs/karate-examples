# Karate Examples

This repository contains examples of how to use Karate and demonstrates integrations with 3rd party tools and frameworks.

Each folder should be usable as a stand-alone Karate project.

## Other Examples

### Karate Demo
For core examples, please refer to the [`karate-demo`](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/tree/master/karate-demo). This is not designed to be a stand-alone project and is more a regression test-suite for Karate itself. But it has a lot of examples of how to use Karate.

### Karate Template
Use the [karate-template](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate-template) GitHub project if you are looking for a quick-start "skeleton" to create a new Karate project.
